Just Bubbles is an arcade style fidget game that asks nothing of you but to have fun. We felt that the bubble shooters out there were cluttered and strangely expensive. Some even required you to watch ads just to keep playing. We set out to make a clean and simple game with no ads, no micro-transactions, and no subscriptions.

We chose a colourful but relaxed palette to bring a sense of lighthearted fun. The bubbles are vibrant but not glaring, with a subtle transparency to mute the brightness and be cohesive with the background. We made the background a mystical range of silhouetted mountains blazed in an evening sunset. And so we ask, who is this magician shooting down the bubbles in the sky?
